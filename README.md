CS-370-T4536 Current/Emerging Trends in CS 22EW4
**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**
The project included a GameExperience.py which stores the episodes, this is later used by the agent to learn by exploration. The next Python file is TreasureMaze.py, this represents the environment, the maze, which is a 8x8 matrix. These two Python classes were given so we could focus on the deep Q learning aspect of the project. For this project, we were tasked to write the Q-Training algorithm for our agent to maximize the reward of winning the treasure hunt game, with a 100% win.   

**Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:**
When I first started this course, I believed machine learning would be a typical development project. Meaning, if it were a web, mobile, Client/Server, development project, we would be working with data sources, front/back-end designing/coding, requirements, etc. Which I could imagine there are some, if not most, of these components in a machine learning project. There is more depth and consideration to machine learning. There are ethical concerns that should be in the forefront of machine learning. This is an important area that would need more attention when building AI solution. Artificial intelligences adds a deeper level to computer science. We technologists, build solutions to better our societies, AI offers us the ability to build a better society.       

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
We build solutions that improve business processes, entertainment, social platforms, etc. It matters because we simplify tasks so others can expand on their talents and skills.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
As a computer scientist I think analytically, which gives me ability to see the problem and the environment in a unique way. Example; I ask myself, was the process working at some point? If so, what has changed? If not, what is the process meant to do? What if any, are the external dependences for this process? Etc. 
**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
My ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization is to do no harm. Meaning, any user and organization of my solutions will not be financially, mentally,  and physically impacted by what I build. And, with AI, this is especially important since AI has the ability to make critical choices that could have a negative impacts on peopleâ€™s lives.
